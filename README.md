# About Me
👋 Hey there! I’m Luna Fernandez – a frontend developer with a passion for accessibility, ethics, and creating impactful tech experiences. I’m diving deep into the world of frontend, building projects that bring together creativity, functionality, and inclusivity.

💻 Outside of code, I’m a trauma-informed massage therapist, creating healing spaces for those who need it most. Tech has opened doors for me to build something meaningful, and I’m all about using my skills to make a positive impact.
